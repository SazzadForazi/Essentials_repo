# Linux

## Shell
Shell is a program that takes our command and passes them to the operating system.
> Let's understand the shell prompt

```
**'root' :** Currently logged in user, **'874df82e1d5c' :** Name of the machine , **'/' :** Where we are in the file system , **'#' :** Represents the highest privileges
